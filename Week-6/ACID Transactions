You will create a stored procedure routine named TRANSACTION_ROSE which will include TCL commands like COMMIT and ROLLBACK.
Now develop the routine based on the given scenario to execute a transaction.
Scenario: Let's buy Rose a pair of Boots from ShoeShop. So we have to update the Rose balance as well as the ShoeShop balance in the BankAccounts table. Then we also have to update Boots stock in the ShoeShop table. After Boots, let's also attempt to buy Rose a pair of Trainers.
To create the stored procedure routine on Db2, copy the code below and paste it to the textbox of the Run SQL page. Click Run all.

--#SET TERMINATOR @
CREATE PROCEDURE TRANSACTION_ROSE                           -- Name of this stored procedure routine

LANGUAGE SQL                                                -- Language used in this routine 
MODIFIES SQL DATA                                           -- This routine will only write/modify data in the table

BEGIN

        DECLARE SQLCODE INTEGER DEFAULT 0;                  -- Host variable SQLCODE declared and assigned 0
        DECLARE retcode INTEGER DEFAULT 0;                  -- Local variable retcode with declared and assigned 0
        DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION           -- Handler tell the routine what to do when an error or warning occurs
        SET retcode = SQLCODE;                              -- Value of SQLCODE assigned to local variable retcode
        
        UPDATE BankAccounts
        SET Balance = Balance-200
        WHERE AccountName = 'Rose';
        
        UPDATE BankAccounts
        SET Balance = Balance+200
        WHERE AccountName = 'Shoe Shop';
        
        UPDATE ShoeShop
        SET Stock = Stock-1
        WHERE Product = 'Boots';
        
        UPDATE BankAccounts
        SET Balance = Balance-300
        WHERE AccountName = 'Rose';

Let's now check if the transaction can successfully be committed or not. Copy the code below in a new blank script and paste it to the textbox of the Run SQL page. Click Run all.
        
CALL TRANSACTION_ROSE;  -- Caller query

SELECT * FROM BankAccounts;

SELECT * FROM ShoeShop;
